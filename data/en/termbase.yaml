  abbr: HATEOAS
  definition: |
    HATEOAS is a concept in software architecture where the server informs
    the client of all possible endpoints related to the current request.
    This allows the client to use the entire API without knowing it beforehand.
    HATEOAS is mostly used in RESTful APIs.

  abbr: HTTP
  definition: |
    HTTP is a protocol for transferring data on the World Wide Web. It is
    mostly used to transfer web pages and files from a server to a client.
    HTTP is a stateless protocol based on the request-response principle.

- term: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
  abbr: HTTPS
  definition: |
    HTTPS is the encrypted version of the HTTP protocol. All data transferred
    between the server and client is encrypted to prevent third parties from
    viewing it.

  abbr: IDE
  definition: |
    An IDE is an application for developers that aims to make programming
    easier. IDEs are essentially text editors with specific functions for
    software development, such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and
    debugging. They also allow developers to run their applications directly
    from the IDE.
  categories:

- term: Integration Test
  definition: |
    Integration tests are tests that check the interaction between multiple
    components of an application. They verify if the communication between
    components is correct and if the components work together properly.

  abbr: IoT
  definition: |
    The Internet of Things is a network of interconnected devices that can
    exchange data over the internet. These devices can include sensors,
    actuators, and computers. Any type of smart home device falls under the
    term Internet of Things.

  abbr: JVM
  definition: |
    The Java Virtual Machine is the virtual runtime environment for Java
    programs. It is responsible for executing Java bytecode on the target
    system. Since the JVM is present in every Java installation and works
    the same way, it allows Java programs to run on all systems.
- term: JavaScript Object Notation
  abbr: JSON
  definition: |
    JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans
    to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON
    consists of a collection of key-value pairs and arrays, represented in
    a text format. JSON is widely used on the web.

  abbr: MQTT
  definition: |
    MQTT is an open network protocol designed for transferring messages
    between devices in a network. MQTT is a publish-subscribe protocol where
    devices send messages to a broker, which forwards them to all devices
    interested in those messages. MQTT is designed to use minimal resources,
    making it suitable for IoT.

- term: Mocking
  definition: |
    Mocking is a technique in software testing where the dependencies of the
    component being tested are replaced with objects that offer the same
    interface but have predefined behavior. This allows tests to be conducted
    independently of the actual dependencies.

  abbr: NPM
  reference: programming/javascript/npm/
  definition: |
    NPM is a package manager for JavaScript that allows developers to install
    and manage JavaScript packages. These packages contain reusable code,
    reducing code duplication. NPM is the standard package manager for Node.js
    and is mostly used with Node.js projects.

  definition: |
    POSIX is a standard for operating systems that ensures compatibility
    between different operating systems. POSIX defines a set of functions
    that an operating system must implement to be considered POSIX compliant,
    including C system calls and utility programs that must be installed.

  abbr: REST
  definition: |
    REST is an architectural style for distributed systems based on the
    HTTP protocol. Resources are addressed via endpoints. A REST API is
    stateless, so the same request always yields the same result. A fully
    RESTful API must allow the client to use the entire API as long as it
    knows one endpoint. This is enabled by HATEOAS, where the client is
    informed of all endpoints related to the query.

  reference: design-pattern/solid/
  definition: |
    SOLID is an acronym for five design principles defined by Robert C. Martin.
    These principles aim to facilitate the creation of maintainable and
    extensible software components. The principles are:
    - Single Responsibility Principle
    - Open/Closed Principle
    - Liskov Substitution Principle
    - Interface Segregation Principle
    - Dependency Inversion Principle
- term: Same-Origin Policy
  abbr: SOP
  definition: |
    The Same-Origin Policy is a security concept in browsers and web
    applications that prevents client-side scripting languages like
    JavaScript and CSS from accessing objects that do not have the same
    origin, for example, because they come from a different website.

- term: Socket
  definition: |
    A socket is an endpoint of a communication connection between two
    programs. A socket is usually defined by an IP address and a port.
    A socket can act as either a server or a client and allows data to be
    exchanged between programs over the network.

  definition: |
    Test Driven Development is a development practice where tests are written
    first and then the code is written to pass those tests. The code is written
    to only pass the tests and nothing more. TDD helps ensure that the code
    works and exhibits the expected behavior.

  definition: |
    UDP is a protocol for transferring data over a network. UDP is mostly
    used to transfer data quickly and unreliably. UDP does not ensure that
    data is transferred in the correct order or without errors, but transfers
    data as quickly as possible.
