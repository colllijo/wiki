## What is COLL Advent of Code

[`COLL Advent of Code`][aoc-github] is my `C++` library to help solve the
[Avent of Code][aoc] puzzles. Since this library is currently mainly used by me,
the documentation is not yet very detailed and the entire library is still in
early development and may change significantly.  
Currently the following features are included in the library:

- Automatic generation of all solution files for a year
- Execution of the solution of individual days or parts
- Automatic download of the puzzle input
- Automatic submission of the solution
- A (small) library of helper functions
  - Data structure for grids
  - Implementation of often needed algorithms
  - ThreadPool for parallelized solution approaches

## My participation in Advent of Code

Personally, I have been participating in Advent of Code since 2022 and try to
improve myself every year. In my first year, I was not able to solve all the
puzzles in December. By now, I have managed to solve all the puzzles and can
aim to reach the global leaderboard for a first time.

My solutions to the puzzles are also published in my GitHub repository under the
[`colllijo/main`][aoc-github-solutions] branch. Of course, I try to find the most
appropriate solution, but due to the competitive nature of Advent of Code, this
is not always the case, so I cannot guarantee that the code is beautiful or
even works for any input.

As I have not worked with this library in my first two years and only created
it for 2024, my solutions for 2022 and 2023 are not yet available on GitHub.  
But I also try to solve all the old events to prepare myself and improve my
