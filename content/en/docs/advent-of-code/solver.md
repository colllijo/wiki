## What is COLL Advent of Code

[`COLL Advent of Code`][aoc-github] is my `C++` library to help solve the
[Avent of Code][aoc] puzzles. Since this library is currently mainly used by me,
the documentation is not yet very detailed and the entire library is still in
early development and may change significantly.  
Currently the following features are included in the library:

- Automatic generation of all solution files for a year
- Execution of the solution of individual days or parts
- Automatic download of the puzzle input
- Automatic submission of the solution
- A (small) library of helper functions
  - Data structure for grids
  - Implementation of often needed algorithms
  - ThreadPool for parallelized solution approaches
