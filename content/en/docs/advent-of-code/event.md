## Advent of Code

Advent of is a yearly programming competition, created and run by
[Eric Wastl][eric-wastl], that takes the form of an Advent calendar.

>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety
>of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People
>use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice
>problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
>
>You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little
>programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far.
>Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes
>in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.  
> \- Eric Wastl

## Procedure

Advent of Code takes place from December 1st to December 25th. Each day, a new
puzzle is released at midnight EST (UTC-5), 6 am CET (UTC+1). Each puzzle
consists of two parts, with the second part being unlocked after the first part
is solved. For each puzzle, each participant receives their own puzzle input,
which means that each participant receives a different solution.  
When having difficulties with a puzzle, there is the possibility to ask for help
from the community or to study the solutions of others, for this there is a
[Sudreddit][aoc-reddit]. In this subreddit there are also different
visualizations of the solutions as well as funny posts.

## Leaderboard

To foster one's own competitive spirit, Advent of Code has a global leaderboard,
where everyone receives a rank depending on how long it took them to solve a
problem, with the absolute time after the release of the puzzle being decisive.
But since the global leaderboard is very competitive, there is also the option
to create a private leaderboard to have a competition among friends.
