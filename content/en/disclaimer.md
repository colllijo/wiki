## Content

I create and run this wiki with the best of conscience and with the aim of recording the most correct and helpful information possible.
However, I cannot and do not guarantee that the content on this website is always correct, current and complete.
All users of this website are encouraged to review the information provided and decide for themselves
whether they are suitable for their purposes and can then use them at their own risk.

## Links

In this wiki I try to provide links to further information on various topics. However, I have no influence on the linked pages or their content and can therefore not guarantee that they are available or that they still contain the same information as at the time of the link.

  All links to external sites end with the
